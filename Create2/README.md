# DeployWithCreate2 Contract

## Description

The `DeployWithCreate2` contract allows deploying instances of itself using the `Create2` mechanism in Solidity. It introduces the concept of using a salt value to deterministically generate the address for a contract before it is deployed to the Ethereum network.

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the `owner` variable with the provided `_owner` address.

#### Parameters

- `_owner` (address): The address of the contract owner.

## Create2Factory Contract

### Description

The `Create2Factory` contract serves as a factory contract to deploy instances of the `DeployWithCreate2` contract using the `Create2` mechanism and provides methods to interact with the deployment process.

### Functions

#### `deploy(uint _salt) → external`

Deploys an instance of the `DeployWithCreate2` contract using the `Create2` mechanism with the given `_salt` value.

##### Parameters

- `_salt` (uint): The salt value used for the deployment.

#### `getAddress(bytes memory _bytecode, uint _salt) → public view returns (address)`

Calculates and returns the address of a contract that would be deployed using the provided `_bytecode` and `_salt` values.

##### Parameters

- `_bytecode` (bytes): The bytecode of the contract to be deployed.
- `_salt` (uint): The salt value used for the deployment.

##### Returns

- `address`: The address of the contract that would be deployed.

#### `getByteCode(address _owner) → public pure returns (bytes memory)`

Returns the bytecode of the `DeployWithCreate2` contract combined with the encoded `_owner` address. This bytecode can be used to deploy a new instance of the contract with the desired owner.

##### Parameters

- `_owner` (address): The address of the desired owner for the contract.

##### Returns

- `bytes memory`: The bytecode of the contract to be deployed.
